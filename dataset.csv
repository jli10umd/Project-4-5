21,M,16,chasing success,stagnation,"In my opinion the leading cause is a pressure to succeed in life. We have been brought up by our parents and peers to believe that we must work hard in order to be successful, and usually this success is in terms of monetary success. As a result, we grow up feeling like we are failures unless we do well in school and get into a good college so that we can ""do something with our lives."" Being interested in the arts or not being very educationally successful is frowned upon, even if you yourself find happiness in other things. We start to develop these feelings of being useless and not good enough, purely because we've been taught what is considered good and not good.","I think the second leading cause is closely related to this. In many cases, we bite the bullet and make it through our schooling and get that degree. Yet, our problems don't go away, as we now are in a field we have no motivation for or interest in. We start living out our 20's and 30's doing something we hate and sometimes this causes us to feel like our life is a waste. If one can't find happiness in what they do, what is the reason they are even doing it in the first place? We start to feel like its now too late to change and so we are stuck in an uncomfortable and painful situation which impacts our mental health.",free will,ability to form social relationships,societal pressures,"Pressure to raise, and provide for, a child and fear that they might turn out ""unsuccessful""","Pressure to raise, and provide for, a child and fear that they might turn out ""unsuccessful""",Pressure to succeed (both socially and economically)

21,F,16,information overload,societal pressure,"I think the wide network of information people currently has has led to the collective increase in mental health issues because it gives people much more access to the negative things that happen around them. People are aware of many more beauty trends to feel insecure about, more negative news on what is happening around, etc. ","A secondary cause may be the added pressures in todays world to be successful and wealthy. I know a lot of people who struggle with academic pressure and academic validation, and the pressure to get into a good college or get a good career by doing well in everything weighs on a lot of people heavily.
